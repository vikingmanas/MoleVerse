## 🌍 About MoleVerse

**MoleVerse** is an interactive 3D chemistry learning application built for the **Swift Student Challenge**.

Organic chemistry concepts such as molecular geometry, bonding, and the mole often feel abstract and difficult to grasp because they cannot be seen.

MoleVerse solves this problem by:

- Transforming flat chemical formulas into real-time 3D models  
- Making atomic bonds and spatial geometry visible  
- Turning molar mass calculations into interactive simulations  
- Providing contextual AI-powered explanations — fully offline  

Instead of memorizing shapes and formulas, students can rotate, zoom, and explore molecules in real-time.

## ⚛️ Core Features

### 🧪 Interactive 3D Molecules

- Built entirely using **RealityKit**
- Real-time rotation, scaling, and inspection
- Visual representation of atomic bonds
- Accurate spatial geometry
- Preloaded examples:
  - Methane (CH₄)
  - Water (H₂O)
  - Ammonia (NH₃)

Understanding VSEPR geometry becomes intuitive and visual.

---

### 🔬 Molecule Lab (Gamified Learning Mode)

An interactive laboratory experience designed to explain:

- What exactly **1 mole** represents
- How molar mass is calculated
- Atom quantity scaling visually
- Basic stoichiometry concepts

Abstract numbers transform into dynamic visual simulations.

---

### 🧠 On-Device "Quantum AI"

- Powered by Apple Foundation Models
- Fully offline contextual explanations
- Predictive insights about molecular properties
- No internet connectivity required
- Privacy-preserving by design

Acts as a built-in chemistry tutor inside the app.

---

### 📱 iPad Optimized & Accessible

- Designed specifically for larger screens
- Adaptive SwiftUI layout
- VoiceOver support
- Accessible labels for all atomic components
- Apple Human Interface Guidelines compliant

Optimized for immersive educational interaction.

## 💡 Why MoleVerse Matters

Students struggle with chemistry not because it is inherently difficult —  
but because it is invisible.

MoleVerse makes molecular structures:

- 👀 Visible  
- 🎮 Interactive  
- 🧠 Understandable  
- 📚 Memorable  

Learning shifts from passive memorization to active exploration.
